# Blog Content

This repo contains my blog posts in markdown with front matter. The blog is hosted on [adc.pe](https://adc.pe) and [andresdc.net](https://andresdc.net).

## Usage

_**NOTE:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required._

Run the following commands:

```console
pnpm install
pnpm generate
```

This creates `postlist.json` which contains the blog data. GENERATE THE FILE BEFORE EVERY COMMIT.
